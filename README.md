🌱 Why I Built This

I’m a product designer learning frontend development. As a former barista and current coffee nerd, I was frustrated with online calculators that felt like adjusting meds on a spaceship. So I built my own—minimal, clear, and actually fun to use.

This was my first project and I built it from scratch without AI or frameworks. Just raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Call it a pour-over approach to frontend.
